GoingPostal
===========

A responsive web app that checks for shipment confirmation emails in Gmail,
finds tracking numbers (currently only UPS tracking numbers), and plots a 
shipment's progress to its destination on a map.

GoingPostal is the final project created during the Summer 2014 Hackbright 
Academy Software Engineering Fellowship.
